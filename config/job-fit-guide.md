# 🎯 Ideal Job Fit — Mohan Kumar

Based on your resume, here's what the scoring engine will prioritize.

## Your Sweet Spot

**Senior PM / PM (Google L5-equivalent) at AI-forward companies building intelligent products.**

You're strongest where these three overlap:
1. **AI/ML product experience** (GenAI, multi-agent, RAG, NLP) — rare and high-demand
2. **0→1 builder** who ships with measurable outcomes ($7M margin, 15% LTV, patent)
3. **Enterprise + B2B DNA** — you understand stakeholder complexity, pricing, and scale

## Roles That Are Strong Matches (Score 80+)

| Role Pattern | Why It Fits |
|---|---|
| **Senior PM, AI/ML Products** | Direct experience building GenAI, multi-agent, RAG products |
| **PM / Senior PM, Platform/Automation** | Your workflow automation & enterprise background |
| **PM, Developer Tools + AI** | Claude Code, Cursor-type roles — you build tools for builders |
| **PM, Agentic Workflows** | Literally what you've built (multi-agent contract, sales AI) |
| **Senior PM, Conversational AI / Chatbots** | NLP patent, FAQ agents, conversational platforms |
| **Product Manager II, Enterprise SaaS** | Good fit if role requires 3-7 years PM experience |

## Domains You'll Score Highest In

| Domain | Strength | Evidence |
|---|:---:|---|
| AI/ML Products | ★★★★★ | GenAI sales platform, contract analyzer, search engine |
| Enterprise SaaS | ★★★★★ | Weatherford ($7B), TCS, ERP integration |
| Automation & Workflow | ★★★★☆ | Quoting automation, UiPath, OCR pipelines |
| FinTech | ★★★★☆ | ML price optimization, customer resolution automation |
| Developer Tools | ★★★☆☆ | API integration, Python, agentic workflows |
| Healthcare / HealthTech | ★★★☆☆ | OCR+NLP for patient records |

## Red Flags the Scorer Will Penalize

- **Too junior**: "Associate PM", "0-2 years required", "Intern"
- **Too senior**: Roles requiring "10+ years PM experience" — current PM experience is ~7 years
- **Non-PM disguised as PM**: "Project Manager", "Program Manager", "Product Marketing"
- **Heavy operations focus**: Roles that are execution-only without strategy
- **🚨 No visa sponsorship**: Roles stating "does not sponsor", "no visa sponsorship", or "unable to sponsor" — **strong negative score**
- **Domains with no overlap**: Consumer social, gaming (pure), real estate

> **Note**: On-site / in-office is NOT a red flag — open to any work arrangement within the US.

## Your Competitive Edge (What to Emphasize)

1. **AI product shipping velocity** — not just strategy, you've shipped multi-agent systems to production
2. **Measurable impact** — every role has quantified outcomes ($, %, time saved)
3. **Patent holder** — rare for PMs, shows deep technical credibility
4. **Rice MBA** — strategy + marketing lens on top of B.Tech CS foundation
5. **Enterprise scale** — you've shipped to 6,000+ users, not just internal pilots
