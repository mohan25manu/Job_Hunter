# Career Page Navigation Patterns

## Common Career Page Layouts

### Workday
- URL pattern: `*.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com` or `careers.{company}.com`
- Usually has a search box and category filters
- Jobs load dynamically — wait for AJAX content
- Look for "Search Jobs" input field
- Department filter: look for "Product Management" or "Product"

### iCIMS
- URL pattern: `careers-{company}.icims.com`
- Has keyword search and location filters
- Results are paginated
- Each job links to a detail page

### Custom Career Pages
- Highly variable layouts
- Common patterns:
  - Search/filter bar at top
  - Department/team tabs or dropdowns
  - Job cards with title, location, team
  - "View all" or "See more" pagination

## Strategy for Unknown Pages

1. Look for visible job listings on the page first
2. If there's a search box, type "Product Manager"
3. If there are department filters, look for "Product"
4. If there are location filters, set to user preferences
5. Scan all visible results for PM-related titles
6. Click into individual listings for full descriptions if needed
