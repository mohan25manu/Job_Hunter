# LinkedIn Search Strategies

## Primary Search Queries

For Product Manager roles, use these queries in order of priority:

1. `"Product Manager"` — broadest, catches all PM roles
2. `"Senior Product Manager"` — targets senior-level
3. `"Head of Product"` — leadership roles
4. `"Director of Product"` — director-level
5. `"Group Product Manager"` — staff-level

## Filter Combinations

### Default Filters
- **Date Posted**: Past 24 hours (for freshness)
- **Job Type**: Full-time
- **Remote**: Based on user preferences

### Expanded Search (if few results)
- Extend Date Posted to "Past week"
- Remove location filters
- Try broader titles: "PM" or "Product"

## Anti-Detection Playbook

### Timing Rules
- Before first search: wait 2-4 seconds (random)
- Between typing characters: 50-150ms (simulates typing)
- After applying a filter: wait 1-3 seconds
- Between clicking job cards: wait 1-2 seconds
- After loading a job description: wait 2-5 seconds (simulates reading)
- Between pages: wait 3-6 seconds

### Scrolling Behavior
- Never scroll to exact positions — use approximate scrolls
- Scroll gradually (3-5 small scrolls instead of one large jump)
- Pause briefly during scrolling (0.5-1 second)
- Occasionally scroll back up slightly (humans do this)

### Click Behavior
- Don't click in the exact center of elements
- Add slight random offset to click positions
- Hover before clicking (0.3-0.5 second pause)

### Session Limits
- Maximum 3 pages of results per session
- Maximum 25 jobs extracted per page
- Wait at least 30 minutes between LinkedIn sessions
